# Quadcopter Training Project for Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodedree 

## Project overview
This is dog breed classifier project for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program. In this project, I build and train **Reinforcement Learning** model in **Jupiter Notebook** using **Keras** . This code must be able to:


## Prerequisites
The code is **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook** and it uses:

* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [SciKit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

You can install everything you need to run this project with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

## Installing
Clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/rauf-mifteev/DLND_Dog_Classifier.git`

## Run the Code
Navigate to the cloned directories location and start jupyter notebook with dog_app.ipynb

`jupyter notebook Quadcopter_Project.ipynb`
